## **Test Case**

### **Test Case ID:** TC_Database_009  
### **Title:** Validate Database Operations  
### **Preconditions:**  
- Access to database queries and tools (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)  

---

## **Steps:**
1. Register a new user and verify the data is correctly stored in the database.  
2. Perform transactions and ensure data integrity is maintained.  
3. Test database performance under heavy load using tools like JMeter or LoadRunner.  
4. Perform concurrent read/write operations to check consistency.
