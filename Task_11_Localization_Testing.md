## Task 11: Localization Testing

### Task Description
Validate the application's ability to adapt to different regions, languages, and cultural settings.

### Test Steps
1. Verify translation accuracy for all interface text across supported languages.
2. Check that date, time, and number formats update correctly based on the selected locale.
3. Ensure currency format changes according to the region.
4. Validate correct time zone conversions for different regions.
5. Check UI layout for languages with longer text (e.g., German, French).
6. Confirm correct display for right-to-left (RTL) languages (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew), if supported.
7. Verify locale-specific content such as:
   - Address format  
   - Units (metric/imperial)  
   - Holiday/region-based content  

### Expected Results
- All UI text is accurately translated and properly aligned.
- Date, time, numbers, and currency formats switch correctly.
- Time zones display correct local time.
- No UI breakage occurs across different languages.
- Application adapts smoothly across all locales without errors.
